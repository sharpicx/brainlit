## Burpsuite

When i tried to search some texts in the searchbar, it would record the activities into the burpsuite. Well, i was so attracted because of that.

Then i sent it to the repeater and i saw something cool that looks like deserialization using json formatted. And then, i modified it a little bit weird and had been testing it as well. Well, I was so curious to make an automated script for this at that time. Because i have to pass my exam :)
